Hey there, somehow you made it — welcome to my website! I use this space to ~~rant about the current job market~~ document my software development journey and share some of the interesting things I discover along the way.

### Starting A Blogging Website And Choosing The Tech Stack

In 2024, having a personal website as a software developer isn't just a nice-to-have—it's become an essential part of our professional toolkit. The more I pondered this idea, the more compelling reasons I found to start sharing my thoughts online. A personal website opens up a world of opportunities, serving as a digital showcase for your skills, experiences, and ideas.

For years, I've dreamed of having a dedicated space to document my learning journey—a place I could access from anywhere and revisit my growth over time. But it's more than just a personal log; I envisioned a platform where I could showcase my work and, hopefully, inspire others from similar backgrounds to embark on their own writing adventures. With my web development background, I craved the ability to customize every aspect of this space, tailoring it to perfectly reflect my personality and goals.

As a minimalist at heart, I set out to create a site that's both sleek and functional. After exploring various React frameworks, UI libraries, and backend designs, I landed on Remix.js. Its simplicity and robust SEO capabilities made it the perfect foundation for my project.

For the user interface, I chose a powerful combination: Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS. This pairing offers a minimalist aesthetic with the flexibility to create highly customized components—exactly what I was looking for. To handle contact form submissions, I integrated Google Apps Script, a free solution that provides reliable email support without the need for a complex backend setup.

This tech stack isn't just about building a website; it's a learning opportunity. Working with Remix and Tailwind allows me to dive deeper into modern web development concepts, expanding my skill set with each feature I implement. And the best part? Thanks to Vercel's free hosting tier and the Google Apps Script API, the only ongoing cost is my annual domain fee. It's an incredibly cost-effective way to maintain a professional online presence while continuously learning and growing as a developer.

As I built this site, I found myself adding features that I personally love in other websites. Let me share some of the cool stuff I've incorporated:

First off, the blog you're reading right now is server-side rendered. This means it loads super fast and plays nice with search engines. I'm pretty excited about that!

I've also set up Google Analytics, mostly out of curiosity. It's fascinating to see where visitors come from and what they're interested in.

If you want to reach out, there's a contact form that makes it easy to drop me a line. I always enjoy connecting with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts.

One thing I'm particularly proud of is how the site looks great on any device. Whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop, everything should adapt smoothly.

I've built the UI to be easily extensible and customizable. As my skills grow or my tastes change, I can easily tweak the look and feel or add new features.

Oh, and don't forget to try out the light and dark themes! I'm a big fan of dark mode myself, but I know everyone has their preference.

These features aren't just checkboxes I ticked off; they're aspects of the site that I genuinely enjoy using. I hope you'll find them as cool and useful as I do!

### What's next?

So, what's next for this little corner of the internet I've carved out? Well, I'm excited to use this space as my digital playground and learning journal. I'll be sharing all sorts of things that get my developer brain buzzing, but I'm particularly pumped about diving into the world of Machine Learning and MLOps.

Expect to see some deep dives into ML algorithms, explorations of the latest MLOps tools, and maybe even some fun projects I'm tinkering with. I'm no expert (yet!), but I love learning in public and sharing what I discover along the way.

If you're curious about machine learning or just enjoy geeking out over tech in general, I'd love for you to join me on this journey. Who knows? We might uncover some cool insights together!

So, bookmark this site, hit that RSS feed, or do whatever it is the cool kids do these days to stay updated. I can't wait to share more with you and hear your thoughts. Let's learn and grow together in this ever-evolving world of tech!
