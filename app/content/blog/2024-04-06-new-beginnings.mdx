Welcome to my website, I use this space to document my learning journey through blog posts and showcase any interesting projects that I’m working on.

### Starting A Blog Website And Choosing The Tech Stack

I've always wanted a place where I can document my learning journey and access it from anywhere. Beyond that, I wanted a platform to showcase my work and inspire others from similar backgrounds to start writing. Given my background in web development, I also wanted complete control over the customization, down to the finest details. So, instead of using existing solutions, I decided to build my own website.

I’m a fan of minimal design, so my primary goal was to keep the site both minimal and functional. After experimenting with a few React frameworks, UI libraries, and backend designs, I ultimately chose Remix.js for its simplicity and easy SEO configuration.

For the UI, I opted for Shadcn UI combined with Tailwind, which provided minimal yet highly customizable components. To handle emails through contact forms, I integrated Google Apps Script, which is free to use and offers solid email support.

This solution is perfect for my needs because it allows me to learn new web development concepts by working with Remix and Tailwind. Plus, it's completely free to host, thanks to Vercel's free tier and the Google Apps Script API. The only cost associated with this website is the annual domain fee.

Now that the basics are covered, let me highlight some key features of the web app, which draws heavy inspiration from Kent C. Dodds’ website:

- **SSR and SEO-Optimized Blog:** Ensures fast load times and better visibility on search engines.
- **Google Analytics:** Tracks website traffic and user behavior.
- **Contact Form:** Facilitates easy communication.
- **Responsive UI:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.
- **Extensible and Customizable UI:** Built with modern web development principles, allowing for easy updates and modifications.
- **Adaptive Light and Dark Themes:** Provides a user-friendly experience with theme preferences.

I’ve made the source code of the project public on GitHub, complete with editable config files to help you get the same website up and running easily. Follow the guide here.

### What's next?

As I mentioned, I’ll be using this space to document my learning journey and share anything that excites me. My main focus will be on writing technical blogs covering various aspects of Machine Learning and MLOps. Keep checking my website to dive into the exciting world of machine learning and discover new insights along the way.
